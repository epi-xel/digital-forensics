Hello Dude!

Can you help me? Suddenly my files changed to mp3's and I got some
strange messages with "IMPORTANT INFORMATION" and I cannot open those
files... I did nothing great, I browsed the web for stuff and then I
got this message...
Maybe you can help me? I got some of the data back, but I saved the mp3
to be safe.

Thank you
Peter
